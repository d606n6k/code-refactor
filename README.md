# <Horiseon Landing Page Code Refactor>
![](horiseon.png)
## Description
- What was your motivation?
Our motivation for refactoring this landing page was to clean up redundant html IDs and classes inside the html and css

- Why did you build this project?
We built this project to showcase Horiseon's products and business offerings. We utilized the skill of refactoring existing code to provide a more concise markup of the index.html and style sheets.

- What problem does it solve?
The original source code for Horiseon's landing page consisted of redundant IDs and classes on the html elements. We reviewed the css and found that there were classes and ID's doing the exact same things for layout. We consolidated the css into single declarations and removed what we did not need from the html.

- What did you learn?
I learned to review code and identify what was being used for styling. I learned that you can have single css declarations for multiple html elements.
